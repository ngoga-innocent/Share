The journey commenced with a focus on providing financial and educational support to orphans and children from underprivileged families in Rwanda, helping them access quality education and healthcare. In addition to these efforts, SHARE emphasized teaching the values of sharing, fostering a spirit of solidarity and mutual support among the younger generation.
